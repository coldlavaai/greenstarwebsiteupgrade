# üöÄ Sanity CMS Setup Guide

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Access the Studio

Start your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit: **http://localhost:3000/studio**

### Step 2: Create Initial Content (IMPORTANT!)

When you first open the Studio, you'll see sections but clicking them gives a "missing document ID" error. This is normal for new installations.

**To fix this**, just click on any section and it will automatically create the document for you. Or, you can click the "Create" button when prompted.

### Step 3: Start Editing!

Once the documents are created (either automatically or by clicking Create):

1. Click on any section (e.g., "Hero Section")
2. Fill in the text fields
3. Upload images by dragging and dropping
4. Click **"Publish"** (top right) to save changes

### Step 4: See Your Changes Live

1. Make changes in Studio and click **"Publish"**
2. Wait 60 seconds for cache to clear
3. Refresh your website to see changes
4. For instant preview: Open your website in another browser tab and refresh after publishing

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing Document ID" Error
**Solution**: Click the **"Create"** button that appears. This creates the document and you can start editing.

### Changes Not Appearing on Website
1. Make sure you clicked **"Publish"** (not just save)
2. Wait 60 seconds for cache to clear
3. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

### Images Not Uploading
1. Check file size (max 10MB)
2. Use supported formats: JPG, PNG, SVG, GIF
3. Try a different browser if issues persist

## Best Practices

‚úÖ **Always Publish** - Draft changes don't go live until you publish

‚úÖ **Use Hotspots** - When uploading images, adjust the hotspot to choose the focal point

‚úÖ **Preview Your Changes** - Open your website in another tab to preview changes after publishing

‚úÖ **Save Frequently** - Studio auto-saves drafts as you type

‚úÖ **Use the History** - Click the clock icon to see and restore previous versions
