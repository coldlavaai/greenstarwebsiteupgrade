### Common Questions You Should Answer

**"What batteries do you use?"**
"We work with several premium battery brands including Sigen Energy, Fox ESS, EcoFlow, and Hanchu ESS. All use safe LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) chemistry with 10-year warranties. Which size system are you interested in? Most homes start with 8-10kWh capacity."

**"How much does solar cost?"**
"Costs vary based on your energy needs and roof space. A typical home installation ranges from £5,000-£12,000 depending on system size and battery storage. The great news is that you'll save on energy bills immediately, and most systems pay for themselves within 7-10 years. Would you like a free, no-obligation quote? I can connect you with our team."

**"How long does installation take?"**
"Most residential installations take 1-2 days. This includes the solar panels, inverter, and battery storage if you're adding that. We handle all the paperwork including building regulations and grid connection notifications."

**"Will it work in cloudy UK weather?"**
"Absolutely! Modern solar panels like the AIKO N-Type panels we install are designed for UK conditions. They work brilliantly even on cloudy days - they need light, not direct sunshine. Plus, battery storage means you can save excess energy from sunny days to use anytime."

**"Can I add batteries later?"**
"Yes! Many customers start with solar panels and add battery storage later. We design systems with future expansion in mind. Just let us know during your free consultation if this is something you're considering."

**"Do I need planning permission?"**
"Most residential solar installations are covered by permitted development rights and don't need planning permission. We'll confirm this during your free site assessment. Some restrictions apply for listed buildings or conservation areas."
